## 1 The Quizzes Tutor supports a course that follows the flipped classroom model facilitating the reuse of questions across the different executions of the course.

1. Goal-source
    - Course teachers that own quizzes-tutor are the ones who provide the business goal. `(we may ask the professor who specifically?)`

2. Goal-subject
    - Teachers interested in using quizzes-tutor in their courses, because evalutation is easier, more flexible and less time consuming; 
    - Students, because evaluation is remote and therefore more practical;
    - Environment, because the need to use paper is removed.

3. Goal-object
    - Quizzes Tutor. `(read System in Table 16.3, page 302 of SAP)`

4. Environment
    - Academic evaluation context.

5. Goal
    - Facilitate evalutation by supporting the flipped classroom model and reuse of questions from previous executions of the course. 

6. Goal-measures
	- Total time spent, by the teachers, preparing questions in the beginning or through the course, in contrast to years where traditional evaluation methods were employed - goal achieved if less time spent;
	- Student's level of satisfaction in end-of-semester feedback surveys, in contrast to years where traditional evaluation methods were employed - goal achieved if satisfaction levels are higher;
	- Amount of paper spent, in contrast to years where traditional evaluation methods were employed - goal achieved if less paper used.

 7. Pedigree and Value: 
 	- `("The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it" - ask the goal source, professor Rito)`



## 2 The Quizzes Tutor promotes the student's learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge.

1. Goal-source
	- Course teachers that own quizzes-tutor are the ones who provide the business goal. `(we may ask the professor who specifically?)`

2. Goal-subject
	- Students, because they are aquiring competence;
	- Quizzes-tutor developers, because there's recognition involved in making a fine learning application that may be used at a greater scale;
	- Schools that benefit from having this system for student evaluation, because they want to form competent engineers.

3. Goal-object
	- Quizzes-tutor. `(read System in Table 16.3, page 302 of SAP)`

4. Environment
	- Academic study context.

5. Goal
	- Promote the student's learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge.

6. Goal-measure
	- The student's grades, in contrast to years where traditional teaching methods were employed - goal achieved if grades are higher.

7. Value
	- `("The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it" - ask the goal source, professor Rito)`



## 3 The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects to learn how to develop a web application.

### Scenario 1: The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects.
1. Goal-source
	- Course teachers that desire to use quizzes-tutor as a pedagogical tool, as project-study material, are the ones who provide the business goal. `(we may ask the professor which courses use Quizzes Tutor as Project-study material specifically, but we'd guess Software Engineering and Software Arquitectures?)`

2. Goal-subject
	- Course teachers that desire to use quizzes-tutor as a pedagogical tool, as project-study material, because less time is used when preparing projects and teaching process brings course students closer to a real world scenario;
	- IST, because their students have more experience about the developing of real world web applications.

3. Goal-object
	- Quizzes-Tutor. 

4. Environment
	- Academic context.

5. Goal
	- The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool.
	
6. Goal-measure (examples, based on goal categories)
	- Total time spent, by the teachers, preparing course projects, in contrast with years where other projects were prepared - goal achieved if less time spent.

7. Value
	- `("The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it" - ask the goal source, professor Rito)`



### Scenario 2: The students learn how to develop a web application more easily.
1. Goal-source
	- Course teachers that desire to use quizzes-tutor as a pedagogical tool, as project-study material, are the ones who provide the business goal. `(we may ask the professor which courses use Quizzes Tutor as Project-study material specifically, but we'd guess Software Engineering and Software Arquitectures?)`
	
2. Goal-subject
	- Students, because they're offered the opportunity to gain competence.
	- `(The Professors because their students become familiar with web application development?)`

3. Goal-object
	- The students.

4. Environment
	- Academic learning context.

5. Goal
	- The students learn how to develop a web application more easily.

6. Goal-measure (examples, based on goal categories)
    - The student's project grades, in contrast to years where other projects were prepared - goal achieved if project grades are higher.
    - `(While developing web applications Students do less errors, take less time and at a lower cost in the future(aplica-se ao Environment?)`

7. Value
	- `("The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it" - ask the goal source, professor Rito)`


`NOTES`
   - Was it ok that we broke BG3 into 2 distinct Business Goals Scenarios? 
   - Should we had a 3rd Goal ? `(5.3 The quizzes-tutor gets refined each year)`
