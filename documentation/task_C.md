## C1 Identify the Quality Attributes from the Business Goals

### BG1 The Quizzes Tutor supports a course that follows the flipped classroom model facilitating the reuse of questions across the different executions of the course.
-`Reusability` Questions are assets to quizzes-tutor. Reusing these assets provides more consistency, reduces risk and improves productivity during development of the quizzes-tutor throughout the multiple executions of the course.

### BG2 The Quizzes Tutor promotes the student's learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge.
- `Extensibility`: Quizzes Tutor should be extensible, meaning it should be possible for students to add new functionality or modifiy existing ones without negatively affecting existing system functions.
- `Availability`: The questions module and the dicussions module should be funcional and available. This is specialy relevant for students to share knowlegde among each other and to have the ability to discuss the best answers to the available questions.

-`Para BG2 o ênfase será antes na facilidade de adicionar funcionalidades que promovam... e a disponibilidade poderá surgir aqui`

### BG3 The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects to learn how to develop a web application.
- `Modularity`:Having quizzes-tutor modular makes it easier for students to define the modules boundaries, interfaces and responsabilities. This approach is also fundamental to students to later start thinking about transitioning some parts of quizzes-tutor into a microservices.


### Old considerations

#### BG1
- `Availability`: The questions module and the dicussions module should be funcional and available. This is specialy relevant for students to share knowlegde among each other and to have the ability to discuss the best answers to the available questions.
- `Portability`: These functionalities should be available in all other platforms (iOS, Android, multiple browsers, etc..)

### BG2
- `Usability`: The system should be easy to learn and use. Visually it should be effortless and fast to create new discussion topics and visualize their statistics on quizzes, questions and answers.

### BG3
- `Modifiability`: The code should have enough modularity in order for students to add new features or improve existing ones.
- `Development Distributability`: Mosts students work on their personal computers, from home, school or anywhere. The quizzes tutor application should support distributed software development.
