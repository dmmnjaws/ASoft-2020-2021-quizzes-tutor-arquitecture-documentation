`the ASRâ€™s business value and its effect on the architecture need to be reasoned about`

`the time-to-complete needs to be reasoned about`


### **BG1** The Quizzes Tutor supports a course that follows the flipped classroom model relaxing the load on the teaching body while promoting the student's engagement in the course
- `ASR`: A teacher creates and deploys 5 new questions and it's respective answer-options for a lecture quizz. Setting up should take no more than `10?` person-minutes of effort. `(H,H)?` 
- `Atribute Refinement`: Adding new questions `?` 
- `Quality Attribute`: Modifiability 


### **BG2** The Quizzes Tutor promotes the student's learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge
- `ASR`: A teacher creates a new filter for the self-assessment statistics. Setting up should take no more than `20?` person-minutes of effort. `(M,M)?`
- `Atribute Refinement`: Adding new filters `?` 
- `Quality Attribute` : Modifiability/Usability
 

### **BG3** The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects to learn how to develop a web application
- `ASR`: A module that has been identified as having more than 2 sets of responsabilities must be divided into its proper modules `(H.H)?`
- `Atribute Refinement`: Code more modular `?`
- `Quality Attribute` : Modifiability



### Old considerations 

**BG1**
- `ASR`: At the end of the lecture a new quizz is unlocked. The students enter a code to access the quizz. The system must be available throughout the quizz.  `(H,H)?` 
- `Atribute Refinement`: No downtime 
- `Quality Attribute`: Availability
