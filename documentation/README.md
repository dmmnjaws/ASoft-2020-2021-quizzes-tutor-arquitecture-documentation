# ASoF course project. Group 6

## Objectives 
- Propose a decomposition of the Quizzes Tutor domain model using the domain-driven design strategic patterns. Write the scenarios and document the architecture of the Quizzes Tutor.
The work should be driven by the following business goals for the Quizzes Tutor:
1. The Quizzes Tutor supports a course that follows the flipped classroom model facilitating the reuse of questions across the different executions of the course.
2. The Quizzes Tutor promotes the students learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge.
3. The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects to learn how to develop a web application.

## Main responsabilities list
### A
2 person: read the code, infer structure from code, where are the dependencies ? (try finding a tool for reverse engineering)
#### FOR NOW:
- Produce a module-view document:
1. Make an easily understood and organized module diagram
2. Write an element catalogue (what each module is and it's properties)
3. Specify each elements interfaces (what each module's interface (if there's one) offers)
4. Follow the template and examples provided below for more

#### FOR LATER:
- Produce a component-and-connector-view document:
1. Make an easily understood and organized component/connector diagram (extracted from the ER Diagram)
2. Write an element catalogue (what each component/connector is and it's properties)
4. Follow the template and examples provided below for more

### B
1 person: look at the business statement (more info?)
### C
1 person: Infer which are the important qualities by looking at the business goals
- Identify the quality atributes from business goals
- Write the core scenarios for each quality atributes identified
- Identify the ASRs
- Write the ASR Utility Tree in tabular form
- Going back to quality attributes which tactics should we use to fulfill them and where?

### D
1 person: Use some tools to get metrics - coupling, cohesion and complexity
