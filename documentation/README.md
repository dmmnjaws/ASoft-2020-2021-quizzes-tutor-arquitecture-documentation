# ASoF course project. Group 6

## Objectives 
- Propose a decomposition of the Quizzes Tutor domain model using the domain-driven design strategic patterns. Write the scenarios and document the architecture of the Quizzes Tutor.
The work should be driven by the following business goals for the Quizzes Tutor:
1. The Quizzes Tutor supports a course that follows the flipped classroom model facilitating the reuse of questions across the different executions of the course.
2. The Quizzes Tutor promotes the students learning process and self-assessment of their knowledge.
3. The Quizzes Tutor is used as a pedagogical tool, such that groups of students can easily use the system in their projects to learn how to develop a web application.
