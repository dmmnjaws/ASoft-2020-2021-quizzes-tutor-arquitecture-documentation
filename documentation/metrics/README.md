# Captured metrics
This section provides information about the quizzes-tutor's captured metrics for code complexity, structure and cohesion.

* [Better Code Hub](./better-code-hub) contains the downloaded website and a screenshot of the results.
* [Structure101](./structure101) contains:
    * [A short explanation](./structure101/how_structure101_measures_complexity.md) of the metrics used by Structure101
    * [An analysis](./structure101/quizes_tutor_complexity_analysis.md) of the results presentented by Structure101 when examining the quizzes-tutor's code.
    * The Structure101 project file (`s101project.java.hsp`)

For this section the following tools were used:

* [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com/) which checks your GitHub codebase against 10 engineering guidelines devised by the authority in software quality, Software Improvement Group (SIG).

* [Structure101](https://structure101.com/) wich helps visualizing the structure that emerges from source code and gives an instant boost to developer productivity.
