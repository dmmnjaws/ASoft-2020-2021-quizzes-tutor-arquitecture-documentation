# Quizzes-Tutor - Domain Vision Statement

The domain model of quizzes-tutor should provide an application for users to submit and answer questions grouped into quizzes, in the context of a course. Questions are organized by topics. A user's role (student, teacher or administrator) determines what kind of operations the user can do while logged in the system. A student is able to autonomously submit and answer questions, participate in discussions and tournaments and consult his statistics for self-assessment, thus promoting the student's engagement. The system however, isn't meant to fully replace theoretical or practical classes, but to support the flipped classroom model. 

>! In the flipped classroom model, students study the topics beforehand, and these are discussed in class, with the questioning being of the initative of the student.

One of the goals of quizzes-tutor is for this to be developed by students themselves, so the domain model is design to allow **modifiability** and the independent evolution of teams of developers. 

Quizzes-tutor is a modular system, allowing functionalities to be enabled/disabled on demand.
