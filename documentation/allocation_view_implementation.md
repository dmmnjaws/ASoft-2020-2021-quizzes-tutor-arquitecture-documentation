# Quizzes-Tutor - Allocation View: Implementation View

## Primary Presentation

## Element Catalog

## Context Diagram

## Rationale
`As we discussed, this view might be extremely relevant for a new developer that arrives at quizzes-tutor and wishes to take a look at a quick overview of the file system, but since this is listed in "Other Alocation Styles", might not be focal. Anyhow, seems pretty easy to do, so I'd go for it!`

`The relation between the frontend and the backend not having similar implementation structures might open discussion for this to be a design smell that leads to fuzzy boundaries between Bounded Contexts, and therefore should be revised. The teacher already mentioned why this was done this way, and why it's wrong, but I can't remember and it's something we should discuss with him.`
