# Quizzes-Tutor - Allocation View: Implementation View

## Primary Presentation

## Element Catalog

## Context Diagram

## Rationale
`As we discussed, this view might be extremely relevant for a new developer that arrives at quizzes-tutor and wishes to take a look at a quick overview of the file system, but since this is listed in "Other Alocation Styles", might not be focal. Anyhow, seems pretty easy to do, so I'd go for it!`
